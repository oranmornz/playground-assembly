        <h2>Hello, observer.</h2>
        <p>This is a test site, or proving ground. Somewhat of a playground..</p>
        <p>In the upper right hand corner of this page, you will find a menu. It will provide you with access to some of my various technical curiosities.</p>
        <p>There is no over-arcing 'higher purpose' to this project. It exists solely to test, play, and prototype various ideas and concepts that I may or may not extrapolate upon at a later point in time. There is also the bonus in that it serves as a test-case for working out how to manage file & folder systems in a way that works well for me.</p>
        <p>In its present state, there is little real content to be found. What presently exists is what past time has permitted.</p>
        <p>That said, may what there is to be found be of some meaningful interest to you.</p>
